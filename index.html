        <p>I'm an award winning , motivated BTech Computer science undergraduate with a
             passion to improve technical skills and to learn and built cool products. As I  came to know about She Hacks through the Tinkerhub community of my college , I was extremely excited to gather a group of three and to take part in it . Further learning more about the course and stacks involved which I haven't learned and worked on before , I reached on to a 
              conclusion that this is my chance ; my vision is same for the above mentioned, I would wannna learn, explore and challenge these stacks within the time boundary provided with my team mates and I really hope TinkerHub WIT will be full in support
            </P>

        <p>I know nothing is more expensive than a missed opportunity.So, It is a golden opportunity for me to improve my skills and learn new things. Because, as a computer science student,  having technical knowledge and updated about the latest technology is really important. It can be only improved by practice and taking new tasks.
        That's why shehacks is a great chance for polishing skills and work with my team under the mentorship of great mentors.

        <p>I signed up for this event because I discovered that it is a beginner-friendly program. Therefore, I thought it would be a great place to learn new skills, collaborate and build exciting projects. My expectations are to learn something new and interesting, not just for the sake of making projects or anything as such, but, to actually understand and use these skills in different situations as and when they present themselves.
             I believe that this is too good an opportunity to pass, as it enables me to learn, build and grow.</p>
